Here are the main themes of the interview:

1. Education (background, school choices, academic path)
2. Career motivation (choice of sociology, understanding others)
3. Personal experiences (family, living situation)
4. Career development (future plans, current studies)
5. Cross-cultural perspectives (Japanese vs. French education system)

These themes are not mutually exclusive, and the conversation likely flowed between them. However, they provide a general outline of the topics discussed during the interview.
